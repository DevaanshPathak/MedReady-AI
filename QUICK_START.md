## Troubleshooting

### Stop button not appearing?
- Make sure a message is actively streaming
- Check console for errors (F12)
- Refresh the page if needed

### Thinking not showing?
- Toggle must be enabled BEFORE sending message
- Purple icon should light up when on
- Try refreshing if toggle seems stuck

### Web search not appearing?
- Not all questions trigger web search
- AI decides based on query complexity
- Try asking for "latest guidelines" or "recent research"
- Check that EXA_API_KEY is set in .env

### Styling looks off?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check if dark mode is enabled in system
- Try different browser
- Verify Tailwind CSS is compiling
